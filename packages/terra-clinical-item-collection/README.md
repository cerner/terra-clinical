# Terra Clinical Item Collection

[![NPM version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/terra-clinical-item-collection)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/terra-clinical-item-collection)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-core)

An Item Collection is a wrapper component designed to display data as either a table or list of items dependent on the relative container size. Initially data is displayed in a tabular format that flexes the rendered component, but as the container is resized and the indicated breakpoint is hit, the display changes to show the data as a list of items. The terra-table and terra-clinical-item react components will be utilized for displaying the data in these two ways.

Ultimately, the Item Collection component allows consumers to organize tabular data and ensure this data is readable as screen sizes become progressively smaller.

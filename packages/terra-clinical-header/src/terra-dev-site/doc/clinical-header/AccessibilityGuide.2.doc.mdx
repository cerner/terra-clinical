# Accessibility Guide for Terra Clinical Header

Clinical Header allows users to organise web pages using the six levels of section heading. Where `level={1} (<h1>)` is the highest and `level={6} (<h6>)` is the lowest heading level.

## Important Considerations:

### Construction of Headings

- For accessibility best practices, it is recommended that consumers should always use **only one** `<h1>` per page or view.
- Avoid skipping heading levels to be more specific (for example, do not skip from `<h2>` to `<h5>`). However, it is permissible to skip headings in the other direction if it indicates closing a subsection (for example, from `<h5>` to `<h2>`).

### Labeling Section Content

- Sectioning content can be labeled using a combination of the `aria-labelledby` and `id` attributes, with the label concisely describing the purpose of the section. This technique is useful for situations where there is more than one sectioning element on the same page.


```diff
+   const header= <Header text="Test-Header" id="Header" level={2} />;
+   <ContentContainer aria-labelledby="Header" id="content-container" header={header}>
      <div>content</div>;
    </ContentContainer>
```

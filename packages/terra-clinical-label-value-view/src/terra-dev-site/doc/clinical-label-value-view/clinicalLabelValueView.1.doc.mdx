# Terra Clinical Label Value View

The LabelValueView component creates a visual and programmatic association of a label-value pair. An HTML description list is used to create the programmatic structure of the label (a term) to a value (a definition). This semantic structure is critical to support users of assistive technology. 

LabelValueView can be used as a single description list with one label-value pair or as a group of related label-value pairs.
- To use LabelValueView as a description list with a single label-value pair, ensure the `isChildOfDescriptionList` prop is `false`.
- If multiple LabelValueViews are used as a group, then the best practice is to encapsulate them within a single description list `<dl>` element. LabelValueView does not need a dedicated description list and can be added to an existing one. To use LabelValueView as a child of a description list, the `isChildOfDescriptionList` prop needs to be set to `true` .

It is highly recommended to add an element that describes the topic of the description list, such as a heading.

LabelValueViews and the description lists that enclose them are often visually associated with a topic on the page. It is best practice to programmatically associate the LabelValueView with the ID of the topic on the page using one of the following methods:
- If the `isChildOfDescriptionList` prop is set to `false`, associate the list by setting the `topicTextId` prop to the ID of the topic.
- If the `isChildOfDescriptionList` prop is set to `true` please associate the description list with the topic text using the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the description list that points to the ID of the topic.
